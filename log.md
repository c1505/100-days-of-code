# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 03JAN16

**Today's Progress**: Got feedback on pull request to AgileVentures.  Responded with thoughts about the code.  Made a small change and pushed it to get code climate to re-run since there was an error the first time.  That error was resolved, but a test failed seemingly unrelated to the code I changed in CI.  The test failed locally once.  Re-ran 3 times after that and it passed.  Pushed an empty commit this time to see if the build would pass and it did.  Mentioned intermittent failure issue in slack and in the pull request.  Looking back, the same test did fail on at least one previous build.

Worked on some of issue https://github.com/AgileVentures/WebsiteOne/issues/1475 .  The functionality I want is working, but there are some other tests that have started to fail. 

**Thoughts:** Happy to recieve feedback on the pull request and am interested in the conversation and best way to move forward with the desired feature.  Curious what is going on with the intermittently failing test.  Wondering why using activerecord callbacks is a bad idea.
